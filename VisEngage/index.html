	<h1>VisEngage Project</h1>
		<p>Engagement is an important aspect of user experience. While some researchers have investigated user engagement in the context of information visualization, it has not received significant attention. We present an initial draft of a research instrument for assessing user engagement called VisEngage. VisEnage was developed by examining research in multiple disciplines and identifying phenomena relevant to user engagement in information visualization. Characteristics of these phenomena were identified and developed into a questionnaire that can be used to assess engagement.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>How to use VisEngage?</h2>
		<p>The usage of this questionnaire is to be given to participants right after using the target visualization. The items describe participantsâ€™ experience or reaction, and ask for their degree of agreement. For each item, participants need to provide their response with 7 levels Likert-scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree1.</p>
