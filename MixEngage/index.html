		<h1>Evaluating User Engagement in Information Visualization Using Mixed Methods</h1>
			<p>Engagement is an important aspect of user experience, yet evaluating user engagement has not received much attention in the information visualization (InfoVis) literature. For InfoVis design and evaluation, it is useful to understand both the characteristics of user engagement and how engagement develops and changes over time. We describe a human subjects study that used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate user engagement with two different types of visualizations. Multiple qualitative and quantitative approaches methods---including verbal protocols, eye-tracking, questionnaires, and interviews---were employed. We report initial results involving verbal protocols and eye-tracking data. We reflect on the findings and discuss plans for further data analysis and future research.</p>
			
	</div>

	<h2>Experiment Settings</h2>
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-xs-7">In a laboratory room, a participant sit on a chair in front of a desk, there will be a computer that has a microphone to record voice and an eye tracker to collect eye movement data. This particular eye-tracker will be attached on the computer monitor and does not require the participant to wear any additional equipment. During think aloud session, an experimenter would sit next to the participant to provide necessary help and take notes.</div>

	<h2>Subjects</h2>
		<p>Interactive visualizations were shown to the participants in the verbal protocol sessions. Because of the impracticality of studying all visualization techniques, we decided to use two different types of visualizations:
			<ul>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">(a) explanatory---those with pre-defined messages that designers intend to communicate to users (e.g., some infographics and journalistic visualizations)</li>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">(b) exploratory---those with no pre-defined message that need to be investigated to derive meaning (e.g., visual analytics tools).</li>
			</ul>
		Although there is not always a clear distinction between the two types, we believe it is a logical starting point for studying engagement in different contexts. Considering the task complexity that is suitable to our participants as well as the research questions. At the end, we employed two visualizations in the experiment: Oscar Predictions (explanatory type) and The President of United States(exploratory type) </p>

	<h2>Mixed Methods</h2>
		<p>We utilized four methods in data collection: verbal protocol (think aloud), eye-tracking (fixation, cascades, and pupil size), questionnaire (VisEngage), and semi-structure interview. Verbal protocol method would take the highest priority during data collection and analysis while eye-tracking data would take the second.</p>
	
	<h3>Verbal Protocol</h3>
		<p>In this experiment, when participants investigate the diagram, they have to verbalize their emotional status, the parts of visual elements they are investigating, and try to explain why they have certain feelings. The following statements are the samples of think-aloud protocol transcripts.<p>
		</p>As an example of our proposed coding theme, phrases coded in <span class="label label-danger">red</span> is the emotional status, <span class="label label-info">blue</span> represents the parts of visual elements participants are investigating (plus their movement), and <span class="label label-success">green</span> represents why they have certain feelings or thoughts.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">"I <span class="label label-danger">feel surprised</span> because when I <span class="label label-info">move my mouse cursor to this area, there are some colorful things pops up</span>... <span class="label label-success">Is there any meaning of the colors or size? Do the colors represent different categories?</span>".</li>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">"I <span class="label label-danger">feel amazed</span> by the <span class="label label-info">information shown in this section of the diagram</span>, <span class="label label-success">the ratio of women vs men is very unbalanced in this country. I am wondering why this is the case?</span>"</li>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">"I am <span class="label label-danger">frustrated</span> by the confusing control at <span class="label label-info">this spot</span>, <span class="label label-success">the meaning of the lines and shapes here is not clear to me</span>...I am <span class="label label-info">moving the cursor over the words</span>. Hmm... Nothing changes."</li>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">"I find <span class="label label-info">this section of the diagram</span> <span class="label label-danger">boring</span> <span class="label label-success">because I am learning nothing new from it. I already know that life expectancy in Japan is one of the highest in the world from high school</span>."</li>
			</ul>	

	<h3>Eye-Tracking</h3>
		<p>Eye-tracking studies aim to identify and analyze participants' patterns of visual attention when they perform tasks or activities. The eye-tracker will be used in this study is Tobii X3-120, based on its specification, we are going to analyze the following three eye-movement indicators:</p>

		<h4>Fixation</h4> Fixation represents those times when participant's eyes stop scanning about the scene and holding the central foveal vision in place. Fixation data should have duration, spatial location, and timestamps. It can reveal useful information about attention (what participants are looking at), visibility (how long participants are looking at), mental processing, and understanding (need to be studied together with the saccades).
		<h4>Saccades</h4> Saccades represents the eye movement from one point of interest to another. The sequence of fixation and saccades can help experimenter elicit how people's perception guild their mental processing and understanding.
		<h4>Pupil size</h4> Pupil size may change in response to multiple factors such as mental workload, lighting, stress and fatigue. By measuring the changes of pupil diameter compared to baseline, researchers can examine participant's possible emotional reaction cues and supplement verbal protocol data analysis.

	<h3>Questionnaire</h3>
		<p>In this study, researchers will utilize VisEngage questionnaire as the instruments of subjectively assessing user's engagement level and emotions. It is a self-assessment questionnaire that provides insight into 11 different characteristics of user engagement. The usage of this questionnaire is to be given to participants right after using the target visualization. The items describe participants' experience or reaction, and ask for their degree of agreement. For each item, participants need to provide their response with 7 levels Likert-scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree".</p>
		<p>You can learn more about this questionnaire here:</p>

	<h3>Interview</h3>
		<p>After participants finish the main sessions, they will be interviewed individually to determine their thoughts and opinions. The purpose of this semi-structure interview session is to catch what researchers possibly missed from the verbal protocol approach such as the general experience during the trials, participants' overall reflections, and potential insightful thinking. The following paragraph is the sample script for the semi-structure interview:</p>
			<ul>
			<li class="list-group-item-text">Before this experiment, have you ever seen this type of interactive chart before? In what media?</li>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">What aspects of the diagram engages you the most? Why? </li>
			<li class="list-group-item-text">When you engage with the provided diagrams. How would you explain your experience or emotional status?</li>
				<ul>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">Key words to describe your experience?</li>
				<li class="list-group-item-text">How you build up that feeling?</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
