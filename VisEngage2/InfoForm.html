		Understanding expert opinions on assessing user engagement in information visualization<br />
		Dr. Paul Parsons<br />
		Department of Computer Graphics Technology<br />
		Purdue University</div>
		<u><strong>Key Information</strong></u><br />
		Please take time to review this information carefully. This is a research study. Your participation in this study is voluntary which means that you may choose not to participate at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.&nbsp; You may ask questions to the researchers about the study through e-mail whenever you would like. Be sure you understand what you will do and any possible risks or benefits.<br />
		This study aims to develop an assessment tool for affective engagement in information visualization, this will be done by surveying visualization experts and collecting their opinions on key factors and corresponding questions that are proposed by us. The entire study will last approximately 20-25 minutes.
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<strong><u>What is the purpose of this study?</u></strong><br />
		In order to develop an assessment tool for affective engagement, we have to specify its key factors and develop appropriate questions to quantify each of them. This will be done by surveying visualization experts and collecting their opinions on key factors and corresponding questions that are proposed by us. The goal of this study is to help us revise items and form the final survey instrument for measuring affective engagement in information visualization. We would like to enroll a maximum of 60 people in this study.<br />
		<br />
		<u><strong>What will I do if I choose to be in this study?</strong></u><br />
		After you agree to the electronic consent form, you will fill out two demographic questions. Then you will start the study in the Qualtrics online survey system. During the survey, you will be asked to answer 10 multiple choice questions together with your comments for each one. Your responses will be collected through the Qualtrics online survey system, which is provided by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP) at Purdue University.<br />
		<br />
		<u><strong>How long will I be in the study?</strong></u><br />
		The entire experiment will last <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">approximately 20-25 minutes</span>.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><u>What are the possible risks or discomforts?</u></strong><br />
		The possible risks from participating in this study are minimal and no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life. This study is designed for participants to answer their opinions towards the provided survey items. Participants will be asked to give their informed consent prior to participating and will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.<br />
		Breach of confidentiality is always a risk with data, but we will take precautions to minimize this risk as described in the confidentiality section. All collected data including signed consent forms and participants&rsquo; responses will be stored in the Qualtrics online survey system, which is provided by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP) at Purdue University, and secured by Purdue&rsquo;s two-factor authentication system BoilerKey. Participants&rsquo; identifies will only be known by the researchers. We will not use the data for other research activities. The data will be kept indefinitely only for use in this research project. Only the researchers in this project will have access to the data.<br />
		<br />
		<u><strong>Are there any potential benefits?</strong></u><br />
		There are no direct benefits to the participants. However, this study may help users become more aware of engagement in information visualizations that they may encounter&mdash;for example: explanatory figures in newspaper and magazines, educational charts in textbooks, and reports from applications such as antivirus software. This research has the potential to aid engineers and designers to develop more enjoyable and pleasing information visualizations.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		<strong><u>Will I receive payment or other incentive?</u></strong><br />
		You will be compensated with a <span style="background-color:#FFD700;">$10</span> giftcard for you participation in the study. After completing the survey, a giftcard (Amazon or Paypal) will be sent to your e-mail address by the researchers. If you choose to quit the experiment before completion you will not get your compensation.<br />
		<br />
		<u><strong>Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?</strong>&nbsp;</u><br />
		The project&#39;s research records may be reviewed by US DHHS Office for Human Research Protections, and by departments at Purdue University responsible for regulatory and research oversight.<br />
		Only the research team will have access to the collected data. Data includes signed consent forms and participants&rsquo; responses will be stored in the Qualtrics online survey system, which is provided by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP) at Purdue University, and secured by Purdue&rsquo;s two-factor authentication system BoilerKey. Participants&rsquo; identies will only be known by the researchers. We will not use the data for other research activities.<br />
		<br />
		<u><strong>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</strong></u><br />
		You do not have to participate in this research project. If you agree to participate, you may withdraw your participation by closing your browser directly at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.<br />
		(for participants located in the European Union) To opt out of participation or withdraw your consent please notify a member of the research team.&nbsp; The names and contact information for the investigators are listed below.
